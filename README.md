## Rating Products
Weighted product scoring considering possible factors.

It is the problem of how to calculate the most accurate score by making various evaluations on the points given to a product.

It is the problem of how to calculate the most accurate score by making various evaluations on the points given to a product.

### Average:
Only according to the average of the ratings given to the products by the customers. If we take only the average, we miss the satisfaction trend over time.
### Time-Based Weighted Average: 
For example, the quality of the recent shipping process or the recent attitude of the customers affect the score attitude over time. We can average for different time periods detected to feel the change effect, but for example, a weighted average can be taken with a different weight for the last 30 days, with a lower weight if it has less importance for the last 60 days.
### User-Based Weighted Average: 
I wonder if all the points given by the user should have the same weight. For example, should the points given by the person watching the whole of a purchased online course and watching 1% of them be the same? This concept is called user-based, user-quality. According to the characteristics of the people, a user score can be calculated and the average given by the users who have these scores can be taken by considering things other than progress.
### Weighted Rating: 
In this method, we can use both the time-based method and the user-based method, and we can give weight for both methods.

## Sorting Reviews

The reviews in the ratings don't matter. Because we need the most accurate reviews, the reviews that prove the social proof. As can be seen, the rankings of reviews here are made according to the rate of finding useful or not found under the reviews. Commonly featured reviews are rankings whose people were moved unanimously.

But the important point here is not only to rank the review accordingly, but also to include the quality score determined specifically for the user, and to perform a ranking by giving weight to it.

### Up-Down Difference Score
Up-down, like-dislike, that is, sorting is done over binary values. There is a bias here. Although the difference between the number of ups and the number of downs is large, the difference between the high percentage of up in the whole up-down rating is small, so it is ignored.

### Average Rating / Up Ratio / Up Score
From this rate, the rate of up / like expressions is calculated, that is, only the success rate is considered. So this alone is not enough. We missed the frequency information.

### Wilson Lower Bound Score (WLB Score)
Provides the opportunity to score any item, product or review that has dual interaction. like-dislike, help-or not.

Technique: Computes a confidence interval for the Bernoulli parameter p. It accepts the lower bound of the confidence interval as the WLB score. p is the probability of observing an event.
